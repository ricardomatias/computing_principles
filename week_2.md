# The Importance of Testing

Write some code and test, then repeat till the algorithm is finished.

## Testing

Testing should be an integral part of programming and not a task to the at the end.

## Plotting

*data visualization*

Plotting is a process in which you take a collection of data and make a picture that allows us to visualize the structure of that data.

* understand the performance of the programs

We want to focus on things where the running time is kind of linear or quadratic in the input size,
while avoiding things where the running time is exponential in the input size.

## Grids

Rectangular grids are specified by the number of cells (squares) they have vertically (column) and horizontally (rows), like:

* three by four -> three cells high and four cells across

Grids use matrix's to specify cell locations like -> (2, 3) | 2nd row, 3rd column (index wise)
